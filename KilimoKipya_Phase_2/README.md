# KilimoKipya Marketplace (Phase 2) - README

Welcome to Phase 2 of KilimoKipya, where we have developed a blockchain-powered marketplace designed to connect farmers directly with buyers. This system enhances transparency, credibility, and fair trade within the agricultural value chain. Every transaction made on the platform can be traced back to the individual farmer, building trust between stakeholders and ensuring secure, traceable deals.

## Folder Structure:
```bash
.
├── backend/           # Backend system implemented for the marketplace
├── frontend/          # User interface for both farmers and buyers
├── web3_contracts/    # Smart contracts implementing blockchain for transparency
```
## Key Features
-  Blockchain Integration: Improves transparency and traceability by allowing every transaction to be tracked back to the farmer.
-  Farmer-to-Buyer Connection: Direct marketplace to allow farmers to list their produce and buyers to purchase securely.
-  Enhanced Credibility: Use of blockchain for secure, tamper-proof records improves the credibility of farmers, aiding financial inclusion.

## Usage
-  Frontend: This contains the marketplace's user-facing interface, where farmers can post their produce, and buyers can browse and purchase.
-  Backend: Implements business logic, data handling, and blockchain interactions for the marketplace.
-  Web3 Contracts: Smart contracts deployed to handle marketplace transactions, ensuring transparency and trust between all parties.

## Disclaimer
This Marketplace (Phase 2) was added after being granted extra time in the A2SV Hackathon. Due to this, it is not as polished as the Crop Feasibility Assessment Tool (Phase 1). However, we have successfully implemented blockchain technology to ensure transparency in produce transactions, with every sale traceable back to the farmer. This enhances credibility, fair trade, and financial inclusion.
