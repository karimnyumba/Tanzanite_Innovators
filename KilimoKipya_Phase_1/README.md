# README - Phase 1: Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation Engine

## Overview

The Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation Engine is designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about which crops to plant and what fertilizers to use. This tool was developed in response to one of the most common questions we received from farmers during our initial consultations: **“What crops should I plant, and which fertilizers should I use?”**

## Features

- **Crop Recommendation:** Based on soil health, climate conditions, and market demand, the engine recommends the best crops for a given piece of land.
- **Fertilizer Recommendation:** Tailored advice on the most suitable fertilizers, considering soil type, current nutrient levels, and the specific crop being cultivated.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with simplicity in mind, the tool is accessible to farmers with varying levels of technical expertise.

## Usage

Farmers can input details about their land, including soil type, location, and current crops. The engine processes this data and provides personalized recommendations for the next planting season. The goal is to increase yields and optimize the use of agricultural inputs, thereby improving farmers' profitability.

## Future Developments

Phase 2 of the project will expand on this by creating a marketplace for farmers to sell their produce directly to whole buyers, further enhancing their financial stability and market reach.
